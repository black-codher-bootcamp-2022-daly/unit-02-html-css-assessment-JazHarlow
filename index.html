    <section class="about-me">
    I'm a mom to 3 beautiful children & have spent the last 5
      years raising them whilst training in new skills so that I could become my own boss after spending 12 years in my past career as a Fashion Buyer/Ecommerce Manager. 
      Right now I'm currently doing a Full Stack Developer Bootcamp with Black Codher and I'm really enjoying it and <strong> learning a lot! </strong>
